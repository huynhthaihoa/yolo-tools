# YOLO Tools

Last update: **30/11/2021**

## Introduction
Some scripts I've made for preprocessing the data when I worked on a project about object detection using YOLO model. The repository was forked from [carolinepacheco/convert-yolo-to-pascalvoc](https://github.com/carolinepacheco/convert-yolo-to-pascalvoc) when I was finding a script to help convert the annotation file from YOLO format to Pascal VOC and otherwise, with the final target is to try several models on the same training data without relabeling. During the time working on the project, I've made some more scripts that help me preprocess the data and therefore I expanded the repository to manage them.
